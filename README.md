# rock-paper-scissors
This is a simple rock paper scissors project

Pseudocode:
Computer chooses rock, paper, or scissors randomly
Player chooses rock, paper, or scissors, and if not, then do it again until done
Plays a single round which takes the player's choice and computer's choice and see whether the player or the computer wins, and explain why
Finally, create one last function that combines all of the other function and plays a 5 round game, keeping scores and telling them to the player after each round is over
